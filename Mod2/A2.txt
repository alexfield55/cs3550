Assignment 2 Normal forms

1. Customers Table - I believe this to be in 2NF as it, there is one piece of data in each field, there is no composite key, but there is a transitive dependency between ContactName and ContactTitle
2. Orders - I believe this is in 2NF as all ShipAddress, ShipCity, ShipRegion, ShipPostalCode, ShipCountry seem to be transitively dependent on ShipName
3. Products - I believe this to be in 3NF as every attribute is functionally dependent on the PK.
